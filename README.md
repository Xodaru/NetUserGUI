# Net.exe user GUI

Simple application to provide the output of 'net user %username /do' in a quick and easy to use interface.

It now includes a parser to seperate the required results that can be presented on a control.


### How to use

Simply run the application and enter the username you want to look up.
It's very likely I have not handled all possible returns yet as this has been only tested on my company domain. If you encounter issues feel free to update the development branch or provide me with the sample data I can test. 


# Requirements 

### To compile

* Visual Studio 2017 (Community is fine)
* dotNet 4.5 SDK
